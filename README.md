# Guitar Hero 1 milo stuff

this repo intends on converting stuff from Harmonix's various proprietary formats found inside Guitar Hero 1's .rnd_ps2 files (usually referred to as "milo" files, due to their basically-1:1ness to the later .milo_platform files)

### current conversions working:

* .mesh -> .obj

### conversions not yet implemented:

* .mat -> .mtl
* .tex -> .dds (or png. maybe both)
* .rnd_ps2 -> .gltf (*very* far off)
