# Guitar Hero 1 Milo Conversion Tools

This project intends on converting files from Harmonix's various proprietary
formats found inside Guitar Hero 1's `.rnd_ps2` files (usually referred to as
"milo" files due to their similarities to the newer `.milo_platform` files) into
more standard filetypes, such as `.obj` and `.png`.
